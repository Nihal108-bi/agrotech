###Weather Prediction Flask App
The Weather Prediction Flask App is a web application developed using Flask, designed to predict weather conditions based on user inputs. This application leverages machine learning models to forecast various weather parameters such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more. Users interact with a web-based form where they can input data related to weather conditions, such as temperature in Celsius, humidity, wind speed in miles per hour, and other relevant metrics. The application processes this data through a custom data pipeline that scales the input features and then makes predictions using pre-trained machine learning models.

To set up the application, you will need Python 3.8 or later, along with Flask, scikit-learn, pandas, and other dependencies specified in requirements.txt. First, clone the repository from GitHub and navigate to the project directory. It is recommended to create and activate a virtual environment before installing the dependencies. Make sure to place the preprocessor.pkl and model.pkl files in the artifacts directory, as these files are crucial for preprocessing and prediction.

Once the environment is set up and dependencies are installed, you can start the Flask application by running python app.py. This will launch a local server, which you can access via http://127.0.0.1:5000/predict in your web browser. The application provides two main endpoints: the root endpoint (/) which renders the home page, and the /predict endpoint that displays a form for inputting weather data and processes the submission to provide predictions.
